# MyMachineLearning
Machine Learning scripts/bots that I made at camp, own my own, or other places. 
So far I learned about regression, k_nearest_neighbors, and support vector machines.

# Getting started
Make sure you have all the dependencies installed before running any of the python scripts. There isn't a python dependency file so you'll have to look at the files and check what you need to install. To install type this command in you terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/calee14/MyMachineLearning.git
```

# Deployment
Make sure you have the python command so that you can run the files.

# Built With
