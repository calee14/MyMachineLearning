# MyMachineLearning
Machine Learning scripts/bots that I made at camp, own my own, or other places. 
So far I learned about regression, k_nearest_neighbors, and support vector machines.

# Getting started
Make sure you have all the dependencies installed before running any of the python scripts. There isn't a python dependency file so you'll have to look at the files and check what you need to install. To install type this command in you terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/calee14/MyMachineLearning.git
```
Another way to run my code is to upload it to the [Colaboratory Google](https://colab.research.google.com/) online IDE and run the code there without needing to install anything on your local machine.

# Deployment
Make sure you have the python command so that you can run the files.

# Built With
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) - IDE
- [Colaboratory Google](https://colab.research.google.com/) - Online IDE for machine learning
