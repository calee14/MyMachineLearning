# Hand Recognition API
This is a python API that will detect and recognize certain hand gestures being made. 
# Notes:
- So far this project has been unsuccessful. I can't seem to utilize the opencv modules to recognize a hand without going the hard way, creating a haarcascade.
- I use a precreated hand haarcascade but that will be hard to find.
